## Instruction

```
 Choose the most appropriate looping statement to solve the following
problems and write a program based on the selected looping statement
```
1. Write a program that displays n numbers
    a. Starting from zero.
    b. Starting from one.
    c. Starting from a number entered from the keyboard.
Where n is a positive number to be entered from the keyboard.
2. Write a program that displays the first n positive integer numbers in reversed
    (descending) order where n is a positive number to be entered from the keyboard.
3. Write a program that lets a user to enter numbers as long as s/he has entered a
    positive number. When the user enters a negative number, the program must
    display the prompt that says ‘Now you have entered a negative number’ then after it
    should be terminated.
4. Write a program that displays the upper and the lower cases of each of the Latin
    alphabets as shown in the following example.
    Example
Aa Bb Cc Dd... Zz.
5. Write a program that computes and displays the sum, the difference and the product
    of a range of consecutive numbers where the starting and ending numbers of the
    range are to be entered from the keyboard.
6. Write a program that computes and displays the sum of the reciprocals of n positive
    numbers, where n is positive integer number to be entered from the keyboard.
Example
1+1/2+1/3+... +1/n.
7. Write a program that computes and displays the square root each of the numbers
    entered from the keyboard. Once a number is entered and its square root is
    displayed, the program should only continue repeating the same task if the user is
    willing to do.
8. Write a program that calculates and displays the factorial of n where n is a positive
    integer number to be entered from the keyboard.
Example
    n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) *... * 2 * 1
    1! = 0! = 1
9. Write a program accepts list of marks of students and counts the number of
    students who have scored marks greater than 20 in an exam out of 30. The total
    number of students who took the test is to be entered from the keyboard.
10. Write a program that displays the maximum and the minimum of a list of numbers
entered from the keyboard. Where the size of the list is to be entered from the
keyboard.
11. Write a program that reverses the digits of a given positive integer number entered
from the keyboard.
12. Write a program that displays the multiplication table in a proper output format.

13. Write separate programs that generate each of the following patterns.
